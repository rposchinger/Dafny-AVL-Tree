# Dafny-AVL-Tree
AVL-Tree implemented in Dafny

All proof obligations could be verified successfully. However, it was possible to verify invalid counterexamples. This leads to the assumption that Dafny does currently not completely check multiple predicates.

The project is part of the seminar Deductive Softwareverification at LMU Munich.
